### Prerequisites

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 8.0+ with npm

    - if you use any other command-line http server just change it in `serve-prod` npm script

### Running

Check package.json for scripts, but mainly
- `$ npm start` for development environment with code watch + hot reloading and
- `$ npm run build && npm run serve-prod` for static production build


#### Issues, notes & todos

- Single layout with no scrolling 
- Animated react logo, date, location, links to event hubs (meetup, facebook, ...)
- nice domain name, see available 
    - react.**ljubljana-meetup.info**
    - react.**ljubljana.tech**
