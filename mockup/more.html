        <p>Just curious what the fuss is all about? No problem. This event is welcoming to all skill levels. It will be a great opportunity to see what other React developers are busy with, compare tool belts and maybe even add some new tools to it. Are you available for work? I'm sure somebody will gladly have a word with you.</p>
        <p>Poligon was really friendly and on board with the idea so they have set us up with an ideal location and environment at their Creative Centre. Gals and guys at PovioLabs were also supper supportive and will make sure no one leaves with an empty belly or dry mouth!</p>
        <p>Always best to take it one step at the time, but with your help next step could be a proper React community.</p>
        <p>Come join us.</p>
